How to operate Bluetooth module?

You can directly use the Bluetooth module after purchasing from market, because there is no need to change any setting of Bluetooth module. Default baud rate of new Bluetooth module is 9600 bps. You just need to connect rx and tx to controller or serial converter and give 5 volt dc regulated power supply to module.

 

Bluetooth module has two modes one is master mode and second one is slave mode. User can set either mode by using some AT commands. Even user can set module’s setting by using AT command. Here is some commands uses are given:

First of all user need to enter AT mode with 38400 bps baud rate by pressing EN button at Bluetooth module or by giving HIGH level at EN pin. Note: all commands should ends with \r\n (0x0d and 0x0a) or ENTER KEY from keyboard.

After it if you send AT to module then module will respond with OK

AT → Test Command

AT+ROLE=0 → Slave Mode select

AT+ROLE=1 → Master Mode select

AT+NAME=xyz  → Set Bluetooth Name

AT+PSWD=xyz → Set Password

AT+UART=<value1>,<value2>,<value3>  → set Baud rate

Eg. AT+UART=9600,0,0

Pin Description of accelerometer

    STATE  → Open
    Rx  → Serial receiving pin
    Tx  → Serial transmitting pin
    GND   → ground
    Vcc     → +5volt dc
    EN       → to enter in AT mode

 

 
Working Explanation

In this project we have used a toy car for demonstration. Here we have selected a RF toy car with moving left right steering feature. After buying this car we have replaced its RF circuit with our Arduino circuit. This car have two dc motors at its front and rear side. Front side motor is used for giving direction to car means turning left or right side (like real car steering feature). And rear side motor is used for driving the car in forward and backward direction. A Bluetooth module is used to receive command from android phone and Arduino UNO is used for controlling the whole system.

Bluetooth controlled robo car block diagram

Bluetooth controlled car moves according to button touched in the android Bluetooth mobile app. To run this project first we need to download Bluetooth app form Google play store. We can use any Bluetooth app that supporting or can send data. Here are some apps' name that might work correctly.

- Bluetooth Spp pro

- Bluetooth controller

 

After installing app you need to open it and then search Bluetooth device and select desired Bluetooth device. And then configure keys. Here in this project we have used Bluetooth controller app.

    Download and install Bluetooth Controller.
    Turned ON mobile Bluetooth.
    Now open Bluetooth controller app
    Press scan
    Select desired Bluetooth device
    Now set keys by pressing set buttons on screen. To set keys we need to press ‘set button’ and set key according to picture given below:

Bluetooth Controller Android App

After setting keys press ok. 

When we touch forward button in Bluetooth controller app then car start moving in forward direction and moving continues forward until next command comes.

When we touch backward button in Bluetooth controller app then car start moving in reverse direction and moving continues reverse until next command comes.

When we touch left button in Bluetooth controller app then car start moving in left direction and moving continues left until next command comes. In this condition front side motor turns front side wheels in left direction and rear motor runs in forward direction.

When we touch right button in Bluetooth controller app then car start moving in right direction and moving continues right until next command comes. In this condition front side motor turns front side wheels in right direction and rear motor runs in forward direction.

And by touching stop button we can stop the car
