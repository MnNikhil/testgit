Artificial Neural Network Based Verification of Digital Signature

Abstract 
-
The 
human  signature  is  proven  to  be  the  most 
important for access. Signature of the person is proven to be 
the  important  biometric  attribute  of  a  human  being  which 
can  be  used  to  authenticate  human  identity  [1].  There  are 
many biometric  characteristics by whic
h  one  can  have own 
identity   like   face   recognition,   fingerprint   detection,   iris 
inspection  and  retina  scanning  [2].  Voice  reorganization 
and signature verification are the upcoming technologies for 
the human identity.
Human  signature  can  be  handling  as  the 
image  and  can 
be  recognized  by  using  the  computer  vision  and  neural 
network.  With  the  help  of  the  modern  technology  there  is 
possibility to develop such algorithm with help of which one 
can  able  to  recognize  and  verify  the  human  signature.  This 
paper   deals
with   the   off
-
line   signature   recognition   & 
verification   using   neural   network   in   which   the   human 
signature  is  captured  and  presented  in  the  image  format  to 
the system. Various image processing techniques are used to 
recognize and verify the signature.
