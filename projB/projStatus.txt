The 
human  signature  is  proven  to  be  the  most 
important for access. Signature of the person is proven to be 
the  important  biometric  attribute  of  a  human  being  which 
can  be  used  to  authenticate  human  identity  [1].  There  are 
many biometric  characteristics by whic
h  one  can  have own 
identity   like   face   recognition,   fingerprint   detection,   iris 
inspection  and  retina  scanning  [2].  Voice  reorganization 
and signature verification are the upcoming technologies for 
the human identity.
Human  signature  can  be  handling  as  the 
image  and  can 
be  recognized  by  using  the  computer  vision  and  neural 
network.  With  the  help  of  the  modern  technology  there  is 
possibility to develop such algorithm with help of which one 
can  able  to  recognize  and  verify  the  human  signature.  This 
paper   deals

line   signature   recognition   & 
verification   using   neural   network   in   which   the   human 
signature  is  captured  and  presented  in  the  image  format  to 
the system. Various image processing techniques are used to 
recognize and verify the signature.

Signature   is   socially   accepted   &   extensively   used 
means   for   authentication   in   our   daily   life.   Manual 
signature is very basic method for person for 
recognition 
of  the  signer  of  the  document  with  the  assumption  that 
signature changes slowly & virtually impossible  to forge 
without  detection
[1]
. 
A  signature  may  articulate  as  a 
behavioral  biometric.  It  is  widely  used  to  recognize  a 
person    delivering    out 
daily    procedures    i.e.    bank 
operations,  document  analysis,  electronic  funds  transfer, 
and  access  control,  by  using  his  manual  signature
[1]
. 
This system has two distinct but strongly related tasks as 
recognition  of  the  signature  &  verifying  it  whether  it  is
genuine or forged
